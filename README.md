Explore and Summarize Data
I decided to explorer the data set: Red Wine_Quality, because it is interesting for me to know, what chemical properties speak for a good wine quality. This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). By analysing of this data set I want to set a focus on a question: Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?
